# psort
purkinjeSort

## How to Install
This package is available either through Pypi or the Anaconda ecosystem.

### Pypi (pip) install
`pip install psort`

### Anaconda install
If you have `conda_forge` added as a default channel on your `.condarc`, then
`conda install -c kyle_poe psort`
If you do not, then just do
`conda install -c kyle_poe psort -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority`
which ensures that only the necessary packages from `conda-forge` are installed through that channel.
