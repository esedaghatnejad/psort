# Synopsis

This is an experiment directory to reproduce the results in 
the paper: "Convolutional Deep Maxout Networks for Phone Recognition"
by László Tóth presented in Interspeech 2014 (http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~tothl/pubs/IS2014-proof.pdf).
In particular it contains code implementing the ideas of and the figures for
the following [deepdish](deepdish.io) posts:
- [Convolutional Deep Maxout Networks for Phone Recognition -- Overview (Part 0)](/path/to/post)

# Prequisites

- HTK version 2.6
- TIMIT database

# Installation

Running `make` should produce the basic figures.  Ensure that HTK 
is on your search path.  Also you should More functionality
to be added later.

# Contents

- sample HTK spectrogram
- spectrogram computation figures - transformation
